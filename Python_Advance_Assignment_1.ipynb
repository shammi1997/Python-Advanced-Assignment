        "2. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
        "3. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
        "4. It comes up with the following advantages:\n",
        "5. It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making it solving easy with the use of objects\n",
        "6. Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program\n",
